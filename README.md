# Open Mover 
Game / Game framework in C++ using OpenGL (GLAD GLFW CGLM)

## Quick start
```console
  $ make main
  $ ./main
```

## Features
 - Solid, and textured rectangles
 - Font rendering
 - Playing audio
 - Input management

TODO:
 - Don't include dependencies directly so use packages from package managers (APT PACMAN...)
 - Compilation on Windows (horrible)
 - Move framework code to separate github repo (Not soon since it still experiencing rapid changes)
